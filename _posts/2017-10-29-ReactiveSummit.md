title: Attending Reactive Summit 2017!!!!
---
Me and my co-intern at Lightbend were lucky enough to get the opportunity to attend The *Reactive Summit 2017*.

![Reactive Summit](https://github.com/lakhina/blog/blob/master/images/reactive.jpeg?raw=true){:class="img-responsive"}

It is a conference about Microservices ,Fast Data and  Distributed Systems which are the trends of today. For the first time this year, they offered a packed workshop schedule for us. These hands-on training workshops were designed to help improve our understanding of microservices, fast data, and domain driven design. We could choose from 1-day, 2-day, or 3-day training:
 - Lightbend Reactive Architecture – 3-day course

 - Developing Microservices Using Actors and Domain-Driven Design – 2-day course

 - Being Reactive with Vert.x and Kubernetes: From 0 to (Micro-) Hero – 2-day course

 - Beyond the Basics: Designing Actor-based Systems at Scale – 2-day course

 - Lightbend Akka Streams – 1-day course

We went for Lightbend Reactive Architecture 3 day workshop. We learnt a lot about designing domain driven programs, need to drift towards microservices and the problems associated with object oriented programming.
So our visit to Austin started with this workshop.


Then on 18th October, the events of the conference started . Registrations followed by key note presentation which was followed by *Welcome Reception* and *Exhibition*.


These events do not exist in the vacuum, they are perceived in their immediate historic context with sprinkles of one's personal life events. We get the opportunity to interact with high tech people, all very expert in their own domain.


 During this exhibition, we came across very popular exhibits by Yoppworks, IBM, Paypal, Squbs and many more.There was one exhibit on Lagom as well , the project I worked on .It was really a proud moment to be part of the Lightbend and Lagom community.


The exhibition time gave us some time to meet our team members , our mentors and other Lightbend community members in person.Since it was the first conference I was attending, I wanted to grab each and every moment out of it. I was really excited to see how it all goes on.


There was a planned *Reactive Summit party* at night with *The Spazmatics*.


The next day all the events of the conference started with a bang. There were many interesting talks going on at the same time. Unfortunately, we could attend only one out of them. It was really  tough  to choose one out of them. All of them seemed equally promising and interesting.


It is rather unfair to identify a talk as the best, since there were many great ones, but these ones hit me directly in the feels.


The ones which attracted me most  and I found really really interesting were “*Building Microservices that Scale and do not Fail*  ” , “*Microservices, The Future of Society, and all that ... (or modularity for extroverts and introverts)*  ”, “*Fast Data with Apache Flink at ING - lessons learned from designing and building a large streaming analytics system* ” , “*From CRUD to Event Sourcing - Why CRUD is the wrong approach for microservices* ” and “*Designing a reactive real-time data platform: Architecture and Infrastructure Challenges* ”.


All the great concepts and talks aside there is still a feeling that we just like to pat ourselves on the backs. It is pleasant to feel that we are better than the rest of the world because we are woke developers  because we are aware. Sobering talks helped, but these things are still prevalent in tech and especially at tech conferences. Its a common belief that programmers and developers are mostly male, meeting few equally good female developers felt really great.


On and on , the Reactive Summit provided me a really mindblowing experience which I will cherish all my life .
